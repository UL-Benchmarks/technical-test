# UL Benchmarks technical test

In public\test.json there are scores in "results[n].scores" that are the most important information of a benchmark run. Scores allow the user to compare their system performance to millions of benchmark runs and the key is to show and visualize them in a meaningful way.

In this task the goal is to modify the scores on the result page in a way that the scores are more presentable, use your imagination - there are no wrong answers. We are looking for clean code and the ability to create smart and creative solutions (eg. numbers, charts, colors, interactivity, etc.)

There is an example image in the root of the project. You can ignore the missing monitoring data in the task.

### How to run:

1. run 'npm install'
2. run 'npm start'
3. use one of the addresses generated
